Genesis Collective Offline Windows HTML Help File

Genesis Collective Offline (GCOffline) is an offline version of the Genesis Collective website (http://www.GenesisCollective.com). GCOffline currently contains the text information from the Genesis database, including all reviews, Game Genie codes, Pro Action Replay codes, hints, cheats, passwords and screenshots.

GCOffline is a Microsoft Windows HTML Help file. HTML help is the standard Windows help file format introduced as a replacement for WinHelp in Windows 95. Any version of Windows should work - if you have problems, see the Troubleshooting page for a link to download the latest version of HTML Help.

GCOffline was generated from the databases used at the Genesis Collective website. The website scripts were modified to produce static HTML pages. HTML Help Workshop was used to combine the almost 4000 files into a compressed, indexed, full-text searchable help system that works just like every other Windows help file.

www.GenesisCollective.com is the the home site for GCOffline. You will find updated game databases there, as well as material you won't see in the basic GCOffline help file, such as cartridge, box and manual scans, PAT files (these you can load directly into emulators to apply Game Genie codes without typing them all), forums and a real community that enjoys the Sega games. Drop in often!
